# Fulcrum

Fulcrum is an iOS application to help people monitor their mental wellness. 
It is currently being targeted at college students and is being developed in conjunction with the
Georgia Tech Counseling Department.

Fulcrum features a daily assessment survey of 10 questions specifically designed to target four areas of
mental wellnesss: Emotional, Social, Academic, and Physical. In addition to this, the app interfaces with
physical trackers (Jawbone for now) to integrate physical data (activity levels, heart rate, sleep patters, etc).

This data can be viewed over time by the user either as a breakdown (Emotional, Social, Academic, Physical) or they
can view their overall 'Wellness Score' which is computed by an agreggation algorithm.
